        The onload event in JavaScript is used in many real-world situations
        where you need to perform some actions after a page or resource has
        finished loading.
      </p>
      Some common use cases for the onload event include: Initializing variables
      or setting default values for elements on a page. Populating dynamic
      content or making API requests to retrieve data after a page has loaded.
      <p>
        Attaching event listeners to elements on a page to respond to user
        interactions. Initializing libraries or plugins after the necessary
        resources have loaded.
      </p>
      Setting the layout or appearance of elements on a page based on the
      dimensions or other properties of the window or document.
      <p>
        By using the onload event, you can ensure that your code only executes
        when all the required resources and elements are available, preventing
        any errors or unexpected behavior.
